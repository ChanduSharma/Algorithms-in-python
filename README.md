# My-Python-codes
This folder mostly contains the codes that I am writing while learning python. Initially I am adding python codes for the algorithms given in the "Introduction to Algorithms" written by Cormen et al.
And the copyright message above every code, well it's generated by an open source editor geany and I didn't bothered to delete it.


Actually, it looks cool that's why I didn't delete them.
