# My-Python-codes
This folder mostly the codes I writing while learning and may contain several codes without exception handling.
May be I'll add them later.Till now I have a program that I loved during my UNIX course.It simply just prints whatever you pass it in
large size by using '#' characters on the console.I don't remember exactly but may be the original banner used the 7 segments instead of 5.Huh! but that would require only a bit of mutation in my code.
